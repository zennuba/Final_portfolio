                <h2>Playdate App Concept</h2>
                <h3>A Safe and Fun Way to Make Playdates</h3>
                <p>This concept focused on developing an intuitive app that empowers children to initiate and manage
                    their own playdates—under light parental guidance. Based on Think Aloud tests the goal was to
                    encourage kids’ independence and planning skills in a safe and manageable way. A low-fidelity
                    prototype was developed with large icons, visual cues, and optional avatars. Parents could approve
                    requests and, if needed, offer to host or help with transportation. The goal was to keep the
                    parent's role clear but limited. The project focused on core functionality and served as a practical
                    exercise in basic user-centred design and prototyping.</p>

                <h3>Rapid Delivery Concept Based on User Research & Design Challenge</h3>
                <p>This project aimed to address the common issue of running out of essential items—such as milk—when
                    time is limited. Through user research, the concept developed into a mobile app called FLUKS. The
                    final outcome was a high-fidelity prototype emphasizing user experience simplicity, speed, and
                    relevance.</p>

                <h3>A portfolio in constant evolution</h3>
                <p>This portfolio is hand-coded from scratch as part of my journey in frontend development and UX
                    design. It showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean, responsive
                    design and user-friendly navigation.
                    Each project presented here reflects my process—from initial research and ideation to prototyping
                    and final implementation.
                    The site is fully responsive and includes a dark/light mode toggle for better accessibility and user
                    preference.
                    I continually refine and update this portfolio to reflect my growth and new projects.</p>

                <h3>Logo Concept Development</h3>
                <p>This assignment focused on creating the appropriate visual identity for a fictional sports club that
                    incorporates both football and hockey. The main emphasis was on selecting a font and establishing a
                    tone of voice that effectively supports both sports—something that feels active, clear, and
                    accessible without being overly loud or playful. I explored how typography and language can convey
                    team spirit and structure while remaining functional across digital platforms.</p>

                <p>An interactive museum installation developed as a concept proposal for Økolariet. The experience
                    communicates complex climate topics—specifically the Danish Green Tripartite Agreement—through an
                    immersive and educational digitalised game for children. By planting trees, adding leaves, and
                    answering biodiversity-related questions, users engage in a playful fight against the climate
                    crisis. The concept highlights how gamification can make environmental issues tangible and memorable
                    for young visitors.</p>

                <h2>Website Redesign</h2>
                <h3>Client-Based Redesign with UX Evaluation, Testing & Live Pitch</h3>
                <p>This project involved the improvement of an existing website through
                    a structured UX evaluation. A heuristic analysis and user testing
                    identified key usability issues, which were translated into clear,
                    actionable design improvements.</p>
                <p>The final result was a high-fidelity prototype developed in Figma,
                    including a redesigned landing page and selected subpages optimized
                    for user experience. All findings and design decisions were
                    documented in a professional client report, supported by a short
                    promotional video. The project concluded with a live pitch to
                    present the concept and rationale to stakeholders.

                    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Lotte Nielsen</strong> — a frontend developer in training at UCL. I build
                        responsive, user-focused websites where structure, storytelling, and design go hand in hand.</p>

                    <p>My approach blends aesthetics with code, always guided by curiosity and a strong sense of
                        clarity. I believe good design solves problems — and great design invites people in.</p>

                    <p>This hand-coded portfolio is part of my first semester, where I’ve explored UX, design thinking,
                        and modern development practices. Each project here reflects my process, progress, and passion.
                    </p>
